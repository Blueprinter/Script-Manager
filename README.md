Set Up Instructions	
	
	You will need to create a bound script with provided code, authorize the script, create a GCP project, enable an API, enable an Advanced Service, and associate the GDP project with the Apps Script project.  I'm providing the code and instructions for how to do the set-up.
	
Create a bound project	
	From the spreadsheet menu, click the "Tools" menu and the "Script editor" menu item.
	The code editor will open
	In the upper left hand corner, click the name - Enter a Name: Script_Manager_Bound
	Go to the code source at the link below
	
	Copy the code.
	Paste the code into the code editor
	Save the File
	
	From the code editor, click the View menu and click "Show manifest file"
	The appsscript.json file will open - you will see it displayed in the code editor
	Copy the appsscript.json file from GitHub and paste it into your appsscript.json file
	Save the file
	
	Got to Link:
	https://console.cloud.google.com/home/dashboard?authuser=0
	Click the drop down list of project names at the top
	In the upper right hand corner click New Project
	Enter a project name
	If you are in a GSuite account and don't have an organization name then create an organization name
	Click Create
